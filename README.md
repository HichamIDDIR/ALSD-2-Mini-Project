## ⚙️ Installation & Setup
- in windows everything is portable



#### Compile & Run the game:
##### For windows : 
```plaintext
Just run the build.bat file.
```


---

## 🎮 How to Play
- **User Setup:** Register a new account or log in (usernames are case-sensitive)
- **Gameplay:** Each level provides a set of letters to form words that:
  - Use only the provided letters
  - Match the required lengths (2-6 letters)
  - Are in the dictionary  
  Complete all required words to advance through 10 levels. Progress saves automatically.

---

## 🔧 Technical Details
- **Libraries:** Raylib 4.5 (graphics/input), RayGUI 3.2 (UI components)
- **Core Functions:** Dictionary loading/validation, level configuration, and user data persistence  
  _Note: The dictionary file (`words.txt`) may take a long time to load due to its size._
- **Limitations:** No error handling for missing files, fixed window size (800x600), basic UI without animations

---

## 📌 Notes:
- Prototype (v0.0.1) for educational purposes.
- No license - for **ALSD 2 (Algorithm et Structure des Données)** course use only.
- The dictionary (`words.txt`) can be replaced with custom word lists.
- All game assets are included in the repository.

### Developed for:
- Algorithm et Structure des Données (ALSD) Course
- Computer Engineering Department
- University of Bejaia
